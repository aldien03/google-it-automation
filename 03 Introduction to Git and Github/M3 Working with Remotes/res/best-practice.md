# Best practice

<br>

### Always synchronize your branches before starting to work on your own.
### Avoid having very large changes that modify a lot of different things.
### When working on a big change, it make sense to have a separate feature branch.
### Regularly merge changes made on the master branch back onto the feature branch.
### Have the latest version of the project in the master branch, and the stable version of the project on a separate branch.
### You should not rebase changes that have been pushed to remote repos.
### Having good commit messages is important.
